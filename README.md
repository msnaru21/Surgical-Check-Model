# Surgical-Check-Model

1. This a machine learning which predicts if a patient can undergo a surgery or not.
2. This is a Logistic Regression Model which takes in certain values 'Chest-Pain', 'Blood-Pressure', 'Blood-Sugar', 'ECG', 'Heart-Rate' and 'Cholestrol' of the patient.
3. The model then checks if these values are in the normal range or not.
4. If the values are normal, the model predicts '1' which means the patient can undergo surgery. Else the patient cannot.
